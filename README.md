A 2D game using SLICK2D

Galactic Empire is a game where the player starts as a basic group of pioneers in a galactic star system that 
is randomly generated at the start of the game. Gradually, the game will turn from a very simple situation into a
complex management system to build up your own empire in space.

Starting out with 4 inhabitants, the player can choose a planet to start his journey in space. He has one spaceship 
that was used to reach the planet, and a basic set of resources. Not many building options are available.

There are two main views, the galactic world view, and the planet view. In the planet view the player can see his 
buildings on a particular planet, the living and oxygen situation, the undergoing work etc. He can here also order new
constructions (for example mineral extracting facilities). 
The spaceship can be controlled in the worldview, and used to transport resources from another planet or asteroid. This
is a good way to reach nearby planets early on, but in order to produce more efficiently and reach farther away planets with
different mineral compositions and living situations, it is possible to build additional cargo ships, expand them with
upgrades (more fuel, faster movement propellers, ...).

The starting planet choice determines which minerals are available early on, and how difficult the survival will be. 
Environments can go from peaceful and bountiful to hostile and very scarce. On such planets, it is very difficult to 
establish a running base and survive, as the player needs to invest into defense systems very early!

Defenses on the planet view take the form of wall-offs and auto-turrets that fend off possible attackers on land. Once
such a turret is placed, it will automatically aim and fire towards any hostile creatures attempting to raid the base.
